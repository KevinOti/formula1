Formula one racing is sport that i cherish a lot, looking back,  years ago i  stayed glued on TV for the sports segment to only confirm who of the drivers was in pole position and won the race.

So much has changed with the internet(news is readily available) and the championship has as well changed, the drivers whom i followed through have since retired, really wanted to review how my favorites have faired through the years.

My Personal favorite was Sebastian Vettel, this was breathe of fresh air, its sad to see that he bowed out of the game, he has four championships to his name, also rooted for Kimi Raikkonen though through and through only managed 1 title.
